#Zorkduino
###Play Zork on your TV with an Arduino.

Who doesn’t love Zork?. Who doesn’t love Arduinos? Why not grab a few cheap components and build an Arduino gadget capable of playing all the classic Infocom games on your TV from the comfort of your couch.

A few years ago I ported a z-machine player to a [little arduino-like device](http://rossumblog.com/2011/04/19/zork-for-the-microtouch/). Ever since I have been meaning to get around to a project that support TV out and a real keyboard that would rekindle memories of long nights playing Zork on my Atari 800.

##You will need:
* Arduino UNO, Pro, Pro Mini or equivalent.
